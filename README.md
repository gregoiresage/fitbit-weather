# Weather module for Fitbit OS

This library permits to retrieve weather information from the device.  
You can choose your favourite weather provider between [OpenWeatherMap](http://api.openweathermap.org), [DarkSky](https://api.darksky.net) and [Weatherbit](https://www.weatherbit.io/)

## Installation

```javascript
npm i fitbit-weather
```

### Companion

Create an *index.js* file in the *companion* folder if you don't already have one.  
Add the following code in this file :

```javascript
import * as weather from 'fitbit-weather/companion'

weather.setup({ provider : weather.Providers.openweathermap, apiKey : 'YOUR_KEY' })
```
### App

Add the following code in your *app/index.js* file

```javascript
import * as weather from 'fitbit-weather/app'

weather.fetch(30 * 60 * 1000) // return the cached value if it is less than 30 minutes old 
  .then(weather => console.log(JSON.stringify(weather)))
  .catch(error => console.log(JSON.stringify(error)))
```

## API

* **companion.setup({ provider, apiKey})** : configure the provider / apiKey used to fetch the weather
* **app.fetch(maximumAge = 0)** : retrieve the weather, if given the parameter is the maximum age in milliseconds of a possible cached weather data that is acceptable to return. Default is `0`
* **app.get()** : returns immediately the last cached weather data (the value can be `undefined` when no data has been received)
